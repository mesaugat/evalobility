# Vulnerability & Patch Management Policy

**Company:** wwktm
**Location:** Kathmandu, Nepal
**Version:** 1.0
**Effective Date:** 2025-04-12
**Owner:** Security Engineering

**Purpose**
Provide a systematic approach to identify, assess, prioritize, and remediate vulnerabilities across our e‑commerce platform, infrastructure, and endpoints.

**Discovery and Assessment**
Weekly automated scans; continuous dependency monitoring; quarterly penetration tests; bug bounty or responsible disclosure channel. Vulnerabilities are triaged by severity and exploitability, with business impact considerations.

**Remediation SLAs**
Critical: 48 hours; High: 7 days; Medium: 30 days; Low: 90 days. Exceptions require documented risk acceptance and compensating controls. Emergency patching is allowed outside maintenance windows with change control notes and rollback plans.

**Change Management & Verification**
Patches follow testing and staged deployment. Post‑patch verification includes functional and security checks. Metrics track backlog, SLA adherence, and time to remediate. Recurring issues trigger root cause analysis and architectural fixes.

**Reporting and Governance**
Leadership receives monthly summaries. Audit trails capture decisions and actions. Vendor vulnerabilities are monitored and coordinated via supplier management.
