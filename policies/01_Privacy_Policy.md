**Company:** wwktm
**Location:** Kathmandu, Nepal
**Version:** 1.0
**Effective Date:** 2025-09-15
**Owner:** Compliance & Risk Office

**Purpose**
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect personal data of customers, users, employees, vendors, and other stakeholders of our e‑commerce operations in Nepal. We are committed to lawful, fair, and transparent processing, and we follow principles of purpose limitation, data minimization, accuracy, security, and accountability. This policy covers data gathered through our website, mobile app, customer service channels, marketing programs, and logistics operations.

**Data We Collect**
We collect identity data (name, email, phone, shipping address), account details, order history, device identifiers, cookies and similar technologies, and limited payment information via secure payment gateways (we do not store full card PAN/CVV). We may collect PAN/VAT-related information when required for invoicing and compliance. Support interactions and feedback provided via chat, email, or phone are retained for quality and dispute resolution.

**Use of Data**
Personal data is used for order fulfillment, delivery coordination, customer support, fraud prevention, personalization, analytics, marketing (with consent), and tax/regulatory compliance. We process data based on legitimate interests, contract performance, consent, or legal obligations. We maintain clear records of processing activities and ensure appropriate retention schedules.

**Sharing and Transfers**
We share limited data with payment processors, logistics partners, cloud service providers, analytics vendors, and authorities when legally required. Cross‑border transfers, if any, are risk‑assessed and safeguarded; where feasible, we prefer local storage within the region. All processors are bound by confidentiality and data protection obligations.

**Security and Rights**
We use encryption in transit and at rest, least‑privilege access, audit logging, and regular reviews. Data subjects may request access, rectification, deletion, objection, and portability. Requests can be made via privacy@<company>.com. Identity verification is required. We aim to respond within reasonable statutory timelines and document decisions for accountability.

**Governance and Review**
This policy aligns with best practices and relevant Nepalese laws and will be reviewed annually or upon regulatory change. Non‑compliance may lead to disciplinary actions and, if applicable, regulatory reporting.
