# Third‑Party & Vendor Risk Management Policy

**Company:** wwktm
**Location:** Kathmandu, Nepal
**Version:** 1.0
**Effective Date:** 2024-06-14
**Owner:** Procurement & Security

**Purpose**
Manage risks associated with third‑party vendors, including payment gateways, logistics providers, cloud platforms, analytics tools, and consultants, to protect our operations and customer data.

**Due Diligence**
Pre‑contract assessments include security questionnaires, certifications, architecture reviews, data flow mapping, and breach history. Vendors handling PII must sign Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) with defined controls and incident notification obligations.

**Contracts and SLAs**
Contracts specify service levels, uptime, support, audit rights, data ownership, termination, and exit assistance. Security requirements cover encryption, access controls, logging, and vulnerability management. We track performance and compliance throughout the relationship.

**Monitoring and Reassessment**
High‑risk vendors are reviewed at least annually. Issues trigger remediation plans or replacement. Vendor incidents are integrated into our IR process. Data transfers and storage locations are documented and reviewed for compliance.

**Offboarding**
Upon termination, vendors must return or securely delete our data and provide attestations. Access is revoked promptly, and integrations are dismantled safely.
