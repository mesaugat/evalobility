# Physical Security & Office Access Policy

**Company:** wwktm
**Location:** Kathmandu, Nepal
**Version:** 1.0
**Effective Date:** 2024-04-25
**Owner:** Facilities & Security

**Purpose**
Protect physical premises, assets, and personnel by defining controls for office access, visitor management, and secure handling of paper records and equipment.

**Access Controls**
Employees must use badges or approved credentials to enter. Visitor logs are maintained, and visitors are escorted. Sensitive areas (server rooms, records storage) have restricted access with auditing. Lost badges must be reported immediately and replaced.

**Monitoring and Safety**
CCTV and alarm systems may be used in accordance with local laws and privacy considerations. Emergency procedures (fire, earthquake, medical) are posted and drilled periodically. First‑aid supplies and safety equipment are maintained.

**Secure Handling**
Paper records with sensitive data are stored securely and disposed via shredding. Devices are locked when unattended. Asset moves are recorded, and equipment is tagged. Clean desk practices are encouraged to reduce exposure of sensitive documents.

**Incidents and Review**
Physical security incidents are logged and investigated. Controls are reviewed annually and after any significant change or incident.
