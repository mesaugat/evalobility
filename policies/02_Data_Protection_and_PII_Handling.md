# Data Protection & PII Handling Policy

**Company:** wwktm
**Location:** Kathmandu, Nepal
**Version:** 1.0
**Effective Date:** 2025-10-01
**Owner:** Data Protection Officer (DPO)

**Purpose**
This policy ensures the protection of personal data and sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) across its lifecycle—from collection and processing to storage, sharing, and disposal. It defines classification, handling standards, roles, and responsibilities for employees, contractors, and third‑party processors engaged in our e‑commerce operations.

**Data Classification**
We classify information as Public, Internal, Confidential, and Sensitive (PII/Financial). Sensitive data includes identity details, contact information, authentication credentials, payment tokens, and any data that can directly identify an individual. Classification labels must be applied in documentation and systems, and drive encryption and access requirements.

**Controls and Handling**
PII collection is limited to what is necessary for service delivery and compliance (data minimization). Encryption at rest (e.g., AES‑256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+) is mandatory. Role‑based access control (RBAC) is enforced, and privileged actions are logged. Payment identifiers are tokenized or masked; full card data must never be retained. Screens and exports must avoid displaying unnecessary PII. Data sharing requires a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with clear security obligations and breach notification clauses.

**Retention and Disposal**
Retention schedules are defined per data type, aligned with business and legal requirements. Secure disposal uses cryptographic wipe or secure deletion tools, with audit trails. Backups are protected and subject to retention policies.

**Training and Audits**
All staff receive annual privacy and security training. Regular audits and access reviews verify compliance. Violations may result in disciplinary actions, contractual remedies, or regulatory reporting.
