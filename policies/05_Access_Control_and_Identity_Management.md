# Access Control & Identity Management Policy

**Company:** wwktm
**Location:** Kathmandu, Nepal
**Version:** 1.0
**Effective Date:** 2025-07-10
**Owner:** IT & Security

**Purpose**
Define how identities (users, service accounts) are created, managed, authenticated, authorized, and reviewed to protect systems and data used in our e‑commerce platform.

**Provisioning and Authorization**
Onboarding is triggered by HR and requires manager approval. Access is granted based on role‑based access control (RBAC) with attribute‑based elements for sensitive workflows. Elevated access is time‑bound and uses just‑in‑time mechanisms. Service accounts have minimal permissions and rotate credentials.

**Authentication and MFA**
Multi‑factor authentication (MFA) is mandatory for administrative, engineering, finance, and access to sensitive systems. Passwords must meet minimum complexity standards. Step‑up authentication is required for risky actions (e.g., refunds, configuration changes).

**Reviews and Revocation**
Quarterly access reviews validate appropriateness. Immediate revocation occurs upon offboarding or role change. Access changes are logged, and privileged access is continuously monitored. Exceptions require documented approval and defined expiration.

**Auditing and Compliance**
We maintain an audit trail of provisioning, de‑provisioning, and privilege changes. Periodic controls testing ensures policy effectiveness. Violations are addressed promptly and may result in corrective actions.
