**Effective Date:** 2025-01-15

**Purpose**
This policy establishes the security governance, controls, and practices necessary to protect information assets, systems, and services that support our e‑commerce operations. It aligns with industry frameworks and sets expectations for leadership, engineering, operations, and all employees.

**Scope & Principles**
Scope includes infrastructure, networks, applications, endpoints, data stores, third‑party services, and physical premises. Principles include risk‑based control selection, least privilege, defense in depth, secure by design, continuous monitoring, and incident readiness. Security responsibilities are embedded in role descriptions and performance metrics.

**Control Domains**
Governance and risk management; asset inventory; identity and access management; cryptography; secure operations; network protection; application security; supplier management; incident management; business continuity; compliance. KPIs include vulnerability SLAs, incident mean‑time‑to‑detect/respond, audit findings closure, and training completion.

**Implementation & Assurance**
We maintain policies, standards, baselines, and runbooks. Security reviews are mandatory for major changes. Logging and monitoring cover authentication, privilege changes, payment events, configuration changes, and data access anomalies. Findings are triaged and tracked to remediation. Leadership reviews security posture quarterly.

**Enforcement**
Non‑compliance may lead to corrective actions, disciplinary measures, or contract consequences. Security exceptions require documented risk acceptance with defined sunset dates.
