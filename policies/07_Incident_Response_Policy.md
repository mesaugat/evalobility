**Effective Date:** 2024-11-05

**Purpose**
Establish a structured process to prepare for, detect, contain, eradicate, and recover from security incidents affecting our e‑commerce operations, and to capture lessons learned.

**Scope and Severity**
Incidents include data breaches, account takeovers, malware infections, DDoS attacks, payment fraud, and insider threats. Severity levels guide response timelines and communications.

**Process**
Prepare: Runbooks, tooling, training, and communication playbooks.
Detect: Monitoring alerts, user reports, threat intel, and anomaly detection.
Contain: Isolate affected systems, block malicious traffic, disable compromised accounts.
Eradicate: Remove malware, close vulnerabilities, reset credentials.
Recover: Restore from clean backups, validate integrity, gradual resumption.
Lessons Learned: Post‑mortem, root cause analysis, and corrective actions.

**Roles and Communication**
RACI includes IR Lead, Technical Response, Legal, Communications, Customer Support, and Vendor Liaison. External notifications to customers or authorities are made when required by law. Internal updates use designated channels with clear status indicators.

**Testing and Improvement**
Tabletop exercises are held twice per year. Metrics include mean time to detect and respond. Findings drive updates to controls, training, and vendor requirements.
