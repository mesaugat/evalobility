**Purpose**
Prevent, detect, and respond to fraud, money laundering, and abuse in our e‑commerce operations, especially for high‑value orders, marketplace sellers, and payouts.

**Identification and Screening**
When applicable, verify identities using lawful means, collect only necessary data, and retain records per policy. Screen against sanctions lists if relevant to cross‑border activities. High‑risk profiles trigger enhanced due diligence and manual review.

Use fraud analytics, behavioral signals, velocity rules, and anomaly detection. Segregate duties for payouts and refunds. Maintain clear escalation paths for suspicious activity to Compliance. Document investigations and outcomes.

**Training and Reporting**
Employees involved in financial operations receive AML and fraud awareness training. We report suspicious activity as required by law and cooperate with authorities. Vendors must adhere to similar standards via contractual obligations.

Metrics track fraud rates, false positives, and recovery outcomes. Controls are adjusted based on trends and incident lessons.
